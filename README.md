Welcome to the repository for my project for CE 20230 at the University of Notre Dame, for Spring 2019. To successfully run my game, place all the .py files, along with the resources foler into the same directory. It's very important that all of these files are together, and that map.txt is inside resources, which is placed along the same path as all the .py files. 

Have fun!
